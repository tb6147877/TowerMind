# 📖 Introduction
This repository provides the official codebase for the paper "TowerMind: A Tower Defence Game Learning Environment and Benchmark for LLM as Agents." The paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05899). Detailed information and implementation specifics of TowerMind can be found in the paper.

# 📦 Getting Started

# 📑 Documentation

TowerMind is built upon the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit. For more details on customizing features, please refer to the official Unity ML-Agents [documentation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

# 🚀 Roadmap
As our team is currently engaged in other ongoing research projects, this repository is not yet fully polished. However, we will continue to actively maintain and update it.

Please note that the current version of TowerMind already fully supports both LLM-based and RL-based evaluations.
